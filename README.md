# Tasklist
Application for prioritizing tasks on a list.

# Scope of the app
Idea behind this application is to replace simple paper-and-pen task lists with an easy to use digital app.
Using this app should be so easy that no instructions are needed. When taken to use this will be 
more effective and easier to use than the old paper version.

# Audience
This application is meant for everyone - regardless of age, education, culture etc.- as long as the user 
can read and write and know the numerals (1, 2, 3,...).

# Features
Following features are included to this first version:
  - Displaying all tasks in the list view. 
  - Viewing details of a task.
  - Adding a new task to the list.
  - Deleting a task.
  - Editing a task:
     * priority (task will be moved to right position in the list when priority changes)
     * name
     * scope
     * readiness (5%, 25&, 50%, 75%, 100%)
     * details.
   - Archiving a task: when readiness is set ot 100%, the user can select wheather the task is deleted or archived.
